# Adapters Module

This module contains external timeline adapters that allow the Time Bandits system to interact with different timelines (blockchains).

## Components:

- **EthereumAdapter.hs**: Adapter for Ethereum blockchain integration
- **CelestiaAdapter.hs**: Adapter for Celestia blockchain integration

The adapters module provides the necessary interfaces to connect the time-bandits system with external blockchain and distributed systems, enabling cross-timeline operations across different technologies.
