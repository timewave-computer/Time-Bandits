# Refactor: To Implement

Status: TODO

- Carefully read through the following files time-bandits/docs/SPEC.md, time-bandits/docs/SYSTEM_CONTRACT.md, as well as all files in time-bandits/docs/ prefixed with "adr_".
- After you've done that run the command `tree` to familiarize ourself with the current file structure.
- The following files in this document contain the phrase "In a real implementation" or "dummy" at the indicated line numbers, begin implementing each of these one-by-one, or connecting these instances to existing implementations which may already be in our repo.
- After you've completed an item, enter the nix environment, build and run the project, along with all tests to make sure it's working.
- If everything is working properly put a check emoji before the filename in this document to indicate it is now complete.
