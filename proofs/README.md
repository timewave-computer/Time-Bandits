# Proofs Module

This module handles proof generation and verification for time-bandits operations.

## Components:

- **ProofGenerator.hs**: Generates proofs for timeline operations
- **ProofVerifier.hs**: Verifies proofs for timeline operations

The proofs module is crucial for ensuring the integrity and validity of operations across timelines, providing cryptographic guarantees for the system's security model.
