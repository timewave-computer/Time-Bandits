# Programs Module

This module contains program-specific logic for the Time Bandits system. Programs define the operations that can be executed across timelines.

## Components:

- **Program.hs**: Defines the core program structure and operations
- **ProgramMemory.hs**: Manages program state and memory across executions 
- **Preconditions.hs**: Defines and evaluates preconditions for program execution

Programs are the primary way that users interact with the Time Bandits system. They define the specific operations that can be performed across timelines.
