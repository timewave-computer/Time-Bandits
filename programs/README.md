# Programs Module

This module contains program-specific logic for the time-bandits system. Programs define the operations that can be executed across timelines.

## Components:

- **Program.hs**: Defines the core program structure and operations
- **ProgramMemory.hs**: Manages program state and memory across executions 
- **Preconditions.hs**: Defines and evaluates preconditions for program execution

Programs are the primary way that users interact with the time-bandits system. They define the specific operations that can be performed across timelines.
