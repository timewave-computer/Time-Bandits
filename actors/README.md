# Actors Module

This module contains actors-specific logic for the time-bandits system. Actors are the entities that interact with timelines and execute programs.

## Components:

- **TimeTraveler.hs**: Implements the time traveler actor that navigates across timelines
- **TimeKeeper.hs**: Implements the time keeper actor that maintains timeline consistency
- **TimeBandit.hs**: Implements the time bandit actor that attempts to exploit timeline vulnerabilities
- **Messaging.hs**: Defines the messaging system for actor communication

Actors form the backbone of the time-bandits system, performing the actual work of navigating, maintaining, and interacting with timelines.
