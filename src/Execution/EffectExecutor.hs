Module: TimeBandits.EffectExecutor
Description: Effect execution and logging system for Time-Bandits.

This module provides the Effect Executor responsible for executing effects.
It implements the initial effect execution pipeline that replaces implicit
state updates with explicit effect execution.

The Effect Executor ensures that:
- All timeline changes happen via Effect application
- No more direct state modificationâ€”everything goes through an effect handler
- All effects are logged in a causally-linked execution log
- All transitions are validated against their proofs

In the Time-Bandits architecture, the EffectExecutor plays several crucial roles:

1. Security Boundary: It acts as the primary security boundary between programs
   and timeline state, ensuring that effects are properly authorized and validated.

2. Execution Log: It maintains a causally-linked execution log that provides
   auditability and enables verification of the entire execution history.

3. Resource Management: It handles resource ownership operations, including
   escrow, claims, and transfers between programs and timelines.

4. Proof Verification: It verifies cryptographic proofs attached to transition
   messages, ensuring the integrity of cross-timeline operations.

The EffectExecutor connects the Programs module (which defines what should happen)
with the Timeline and Adapter modules (which implement how effects are applied
to specific timelines). It serves as the execution engine of the Time-Bandits system.
