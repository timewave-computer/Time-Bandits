# Step 5.5 Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the cleanup work completed as part of Step 5.5 of the Time Bandits refactor plan.

## 1. Deprecated Code Removal

### 1.1 Removed Items

The following deprecated code was removed:

- **TimelineProof** data type and related functions in `TimeBandits.Effects`
- **TimelineMessage** data type and related functions in `TimeBandits.Effects`
- **ResourceOps** typeclass and related operations in `TimeBandits.Effects`

These components have been replaced by dedicated modules that provide more robust implementations:

- `TimeBandits.Timeline` and `TimeBandits.TimelineProof` replace TimelineProof
- `TimeBandits.Timeline` and `TimeBandits.TransitionMessage` replace TimelineMessage
- `TimeBandits.Resource` and `TimeBandits.ResourceLedger` replace ResourceOps

### 1.2 Module Dependencies

All module dependencies were updated to use the new abstractions, ensuring no code depends on deprecated functionality.

## 2. Implicit State Updates

All implicit state updates have been replaced with explicit effect execution through the `EffectExecutor` module. This ensures:

- All state changes are auditable
- Effects are properly validated before execution
- Security properties are maintained throughout state transitions

## 3. Documentation Updates

### 3.1 System Documentation

The following documentation files were updated:

- **SPEC.md**: Updated to reflect the new architecture, including core modules, abstractions, and their relationships.
- **README.md**: Enhanced with information about security verification, modular architecture, and timeline descriptors.
- **refactor.md**: Updated to mark Step 5.5 as completed and Phase 6 as in progress.

### 3.2 New Documentation

The following new documentation was created:

- **migration_guide.md**: Comprehensive guide for users to migrate from old APIs to the new abstractions, including examples and common issues.
- **cleanup_summary.md** (this document): Summary of all cleanup work completed.

## 4. Security Documentation

Security guarantees were documented in several places:

- **SecurityVerifier.hs**: Detailed documentation in the module itself about the security properties enforced.
- **SPEC.md**: Added a section on security verification and the properties it ensures.
- **README.md**: Added a section highlighting the security features of the system.

## 5. Additional Improvements

Several other improvements were made during the cleanup:

- Updated cabal file to include all new modules
- Ensured proper imports across the codebase
- Verified that all modules use the new architectural patterns consistently
- Removed unused imports and dead code

## 6. Next Steps

With Step 5.5 completed, the project is now moving on to Phase 6: Implement Distributed Execution. The first two steps of this phase are already completed:

- Step 6.1: Implement Actor Communication Protocol
- Step 6.2: Implement Local Multi-Process Mode

The team is now working on Step 6.3: Implement Geo-Distributed Mode.
