# CLI Module

This module contains the command-line interface and entry points for the time-bandits system.

## Components:

- **Main.hs**: The main entry point for the CLI application
- **Controller.hs**: Handles the simulation controller logic
- **Commands.hs**: Defines the CLI commands and their handlers

The CLI module provides the user interface for interacting with the time-bandits system, allowing users to run simulations, interact with timelines, and control the system behavior.
