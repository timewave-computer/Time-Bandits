# Execution Module

This module handles the unified interpreter, logging, and state transitions in the Time Bandits system.

## Components:

- **EffectInterpreter.hs**: Interprets effects across the system
- **ExecutionLog.hs**: Logs execution events and state changes
- **StateTransition.hs**: Manages state transitions during execution

The execution module is responsible for the actual execution of operations within the time-bandits system, ensuring proper interpretation of effects and logging of all activities.
